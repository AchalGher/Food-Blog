Project Title:  Food Blog

You’re looking to challenge your skills. You can only post about a certain kind of cuisine and the things you already know before your audience will start to get bored. Maintaining a food blog will mean pushing yourself out of your comfort zone in learning new things to keep people coming back for more. And it’s not just about learning new recipes or techniques.Be part of a community. The food blogging community is HUGE and the people who make it up are very welcoming and helpful, especially to newbies. 
Being an active member of the community will help you to make friends and find collaborators.
